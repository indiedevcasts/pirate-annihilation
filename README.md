# Pirate Annihilation

Hey! I'm creating a 3D hex cell game with Pirates, biomes, and voxel art. I share my gamedev stuff
on [indiedevcasts.com](https://indiedevcasts.com). Feel free to join us!

## Prerequisites

- WGSL linter: `cargo install cargo-wgsl` and it will check wgsl files with VScode.
- A utility tool to generate UUIDs for shaders: `sudo apt install uuid`

## Quickstart

- `cargo run`

## Development resources
